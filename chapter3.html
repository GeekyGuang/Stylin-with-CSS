An expression between parentheses is also an expression, as is a binary operator applied to two expressions or a unary operator applied to one.
            This shows part of the beauty of a language-based interface. Expressions can contain other expressions in a way similar to how subsentences in human languages are nestedâ€”a subsentence can contain its own subsentences, and so on. This allows us to build expressions that describe arbitrarily complex computations. 
            If an expression corresponds to a sentence fragment, a JavaScript statement corresponds to a full sentence. A program is a list of statements.
            The simplest kind of statement is an expression with a semicolon after it. This is a program:</p>
